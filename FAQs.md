### What is Phone Saver?

Phone saver is an Android application that enables you to save a file to your device using the Android share function. This can be done with a single click.

### How do I set up Phone Saver?

* Open the application
* Use the `Add` button to select locations to save to
* Check the `Settings` to configure the application to your needs

### Why can't I select my SD card?

As each manufacturer manages the SD card, it is difficult to implement SD card file management in a way that works for every device. This is currently the biggest feature / bug report for Phone Saver. 
As a work around, you can enable the `Enable location select` setting from the settings menu. This will allow you to select a location when saving a file, and should correctly handle SD cards. 

### I get an "Unsupported" message. What can I do?

If you see this message, please submit a bug report using the link provided on the screen. This will help the developer add support later. 
While you wait for development, you can try enabling the `Force saving` option in the settings. This will bypass a number of validation checks to force the file to save. There is no guarantee this option will work for you.

### Why can't I create a folder in Phone Saver?

Phone Saver is not a file storage manager. To create a new folder to save your content, you will need to use another app.
